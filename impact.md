## Family Impact/Considerations

Having a child with torticollis can require a lot of time and care out of the parents and families. This can mean regular therapy visits and a thoughtful and sometimes time-consuming home exercise program. An article was published with the most common themes that parent’s with a child with CMT face that include unfamiliarity of the diagnosis, differing recommendations from pediatricians, worrying and anxiety about the diagnosis, needing a physical therapist’s reassurance, managing a home program, having family members support, and trying to figure out a cause (Oledzka et al). So, although the birth of a child is a positive life event, it can also be a stressful event especially when there are unforeseen circumstances like an added medical condition afterwards. 

## Impact to Development & Lifespan

CMT is not a lifelong diagnosis and the majority of infants who receive this diagnosis have excellent outcomes with early physical therapy intervention. The impact that CMT will have on your child depends on early referral and physical therapy intervention as well as adherence to the home exercise program (Oledzka et al). Full adherence to these factors contribute to a better resolution of the child’s symptoms. There are studies on untreated CMT, and though it is rare, there are still interventions to help in situations such as these that include botox injections or surgery (Kaplan et al). Spontaneous resolution does not seem to have a reason and there are no current ways to predict who might recover this way (Kaplan et al).
